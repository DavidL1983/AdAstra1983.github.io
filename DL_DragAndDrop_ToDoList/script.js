// 1. Custom Dragula JS: This code initializes the Dragula library with four containers representing the four columns in the task management system - "To Do," "Doing," "Done," and "Trash." The Dragula library is often used for implementing drag-and-drop functionality in web applications. In this case, it allows tasks to be moved between these columns by dragging and dropping them.
dragula([
    document.getElementById("to-do"),
    document.getElementById("doing"),
    document.getElementById("done"),
    document.getElementById("trash")
  ])
